The data can then be aggregated, pre-processed and cached.\r\n\r\n### Interact\r\nSupplying user defined logic: Use Python interactive scripting capabilities to perform analytics and visualize the results. The Data Scientist can interact with the Service via a Web UI or REST API.\r\n\r\n### Compute\r\nUses Cloud Computing features to perform the computational aspect of the analytics.\r\n\r\n### Act\r\nProcess the learned models and trigger actions on insights gained, to create agile Systems & Strategies.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* Provides interactive Python notebooks to allow the definition of user-defined logic for analytics and processing of data \r\n    * Supports many existing packages for visualization and analytics like Pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy, ...\r\n* Offers an RESTful API to support machine based interactions to trigger the analytics and processing.\r\n* Provides hooks to interact with external system (Object Storage & the Systems which needs agility enhancements) \r\n* Easy to deploy (as WSGI application) into existing private and public clouds.\r\n* (Optional) Integration with Hadoop and IaaS based service to enhance the computational aspects.\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n\r\n[Suricate @ OpenShift - requires Authorization!](http://suricate-engjoy.rhcloud.com/)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
